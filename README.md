# Filezone
Filezone is a lightweight library built on top of javascript to handle files in html forms. 

## Main features

- Image thumbnail previews.
- File validation.

## Why another library?

I realize that there [is](https://www.dropzonejs.com/) out there but the reason I decided to write my own are the following:

- I want to seprate file handling in forms with multiple input components.
- Not automating upload when files were dropped in. Upload only when from submit event fired with other form input fields.
- I want to design my own elements.
